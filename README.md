## What is iAVs?

**iAVs** (Integrated Aqua-Vegeculture System) is a scientifically validated, closed-loop food production system that combines aquaculture (fish farming) with soil-based horticulture. It was designed to use water very efficiently while being simple and easy to manage from both practical and technical standpoints.

### How iAVs Works

The iAVs system operates through a natural cycle powered by a simple water pump and timer:

1. **Fish Tank**: Holds fish and acts as the primary water reservoir
2. **Sand Biofilter**: Filled with carefully selected sand, serves as both the growing area for plants and the system's natural filter
3. **Water Pump**: Moves water from the fish tank to the sand biofilter(s)
4. **Timer**: Controls when and for how long the water pump runs

The system creates a symbiotic relationship where:
- Fish produce waste that becomes nutrients for plants
- Plants filter the water, keeping it clean for fish
- The sand biofilter provides both mechanical and biological filtration
- Water is continuously recycled, making the system highly water-efficient

## About This Calculator

The **iAVs Calculator** is a comprehensive design and planning tool that helps you calculate the optimal dimensions and specifications for your iAVs. It implements the scientifically validated ratios and design principles from the official iAVs handbook.

- **Instant Updates**: All calculations update in real-time as you adjust dimensions

### Scientific Foundation

This calculator is based on the official iAVs handbook and implements:

- **Volume Ratio (V:V)**: 1:2 - For every liter of fish tank volume, two liters of biofilter volume
- **Area Ratio (V:A)**: 1:6 - For every cubic meter of fish tank volume, six square meters of biofilter area
- **Optimal Tank Shape**: Catenary curve bottom for efficient waste collection
- **Sand Depth**: 30cm at shallow end with 2cm per meter slope
- **Proven Design Principles**: Based on decades of research and field testing
